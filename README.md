# Turtle-Race
A randomly simulated turtle race! Watch different color turtles race across the screen.


##  Project Breakdown:
1. Create turtles (& find out how many turtles the user wants to race)
2. Place turles (create screen, and place them on x & y axis correctly)
3. Picked colors and number of turtles
4. Race the turtles  (create function to do this)
